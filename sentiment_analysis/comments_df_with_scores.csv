Do not use websites to generate keys or seed words or to sign transactions for you. Do not use random scripts you download and think might be safe to run locally. They might have been good yesterday but today replaced silently and generate predictable keys that the author or website hijacker can quietly steal later.

Hardware wallet will create and manage all keys and addresses for you. The backup mnemonic or seed words can restore it all and regenerate all keys. You don't need to save addresses or public keys or any of that. You normally never even see any keys. Mnemonic must be keep secret, never entered into any online connected device or random downloaded tool. But yes it can be used that way in a pinch, in a software wallet like sparrow, to get access to the coins without hardware to sign the transactions and send off the BTC. You're not going to be stuck if hardware is lost. But remember this if you're typing your seed words mnemonic with a keyboard or phone screen then something isn't right. It should be entered only into hardware screen itself.

But if it's not a dire emergency just buy any other compatible hardware wallet and restore into it. Lately even retail stores have them so just walk in and pick up a sealed one.

[Trezor Safe 5](https://trezor.io/trezor-safe-5) is very nice to use @ $135. Touch screen, swiping, very smooth. Works with PC wallets and Android wallets. It's the best for daily users.

[Coldcard MK4](https://coldcard.com/mk4) @ $178 is great if you want high security, lots of features but not obvious on how to use. It's great if you want to pull it out on rare occasion.

It depends on your circumstances.

We all have been where you're at, read/bookmark this guide and make sure to learn along your journey. 

Congrats on the move, it's never too late, [despite new people thinking otherwise](https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/rskpuf/i_have_only_600_bitcoinsi_missed_the_bus/). ONLY INVEST MONEY YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE. 

Invest in your knowledge, learn about Bitcoin as much as you can. The Bitcoin Standard book is a must read. So is Broken Money book. Get them and READ them both, please. 

Also, **don't reply any DMs**, emails, private messages on other social media, promising to buy Bitcoin from them or get rich quick by investing into some website. They all are scammers. Even the hot Asian chick, he's a scammer too. 

**Price wise, nobody knows what the price will be tomorrow, next week or at the end of the year.** 

**Try ""Bitcoin ONLY"" strategy for at least the first 210,000 block cycle**, you'll sleep much better. Newcomers lose so much money, holding garbage tokens just because someone on YT told them to. If you don't like losing money in [failed coins](https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/how-many-cryptocurrencies-failed), avoid. 

Going DCA is probably the best approach, IMHO. 
Bitcoin to me, is a savings account. If I have some spare cash, I exchange it for sats. Once a week works best for me, but I'm getting paid weekly. If there's a 10% drop in the price since my last buy, I usually double my buy. This [DCA calculator](https://dca.bitnob.com/) might help to decide what will work best for you. In a few years, even $10 dollars a month can make a massive difference. This [DCA blog](https://er-bybitcoin.com/) is pretty interesting too and compares buying bitcoin VS stocks. 

Now, don't buy some fake bitcoin at a spot ETF place or similar, **get the real thing** that you can withdraw anytime you want. Register at a proper exchange and buy real Bitcoin. Any of these will do [https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin](https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin) 

Install (or buy - in case you're getting Bitcoin in Thousands of $) one or more of these wallets.

A few good wallet choices:

[https://blockstream.com/green/](https://blockstream.com/green/) \- Top Security Features, Open Source and Non-Custodial

[https://bluewallet.io](https://bluewallet.io/) \- excellent, easy to use wallet, Open Source and Non-Custodial 

[https://www.sparrowwallet.com](https://www.sparrowwallet.com) - top desktop wallet 

[https://electrum.org](https://electrum.org/) \- Solid choice, Open Source and Non-Custodial, one of the oldest and most trusted Bitcoin Wallets. I prefer the desktop version but it works on mobile too.

Lightning wallets to consider (cheaper and faster transactions, great for small amounts):

[https://phoenix.acinq.co/](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) \- Phoenix - very good wallet, uses Tor for extra privacy, easy for anyone new 

[https://blixtwallet.github.io/](https://blixtwallet.github.io/) \- Blixt - great UI, fast and clean 

[https://breez.technology](https://breez.technology/) \- Breez - excellent POS for small business owners as well as integrated Bitrefill 

[https://zeusln.com/](https://zeusln.com/) Zeus - impressive wallet with many features, can even generate Nostr keys

Hardware Wallets (to store larger amounts):

[Trezor](https://trezor.io/) \- Easy to use, no matter how new in Bitcoin you're. Use the Bitcoin only firmware as it's safer than a multi coin software. 

[ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/) - air gapped, Bitcoin only, has advanced features but a new user will do fine with one of the great tutorials available.

[BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/bitcoin-only/) - another great little device, opt for the more secure Bitcoin ONLY version (less coins = less code = less chance for a hidden bug or a backdoor) 

[Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade) - air gapped, fully open source, Bitcoin only, great features. There's a newer version called Jade Plus, it has much better camera and overall is a better, although a bit more expensive, option. 

You can even [build it on your own](https://github.com/Blockstream/jade/), if you feel adventurous.  

[Seedsigner](https://github.com/SeedSigner/seedsigner) - another DIY, fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, not for you if you're just starting up but something to consider later.

[Krux wallet](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/) - one more DIY hardware device, I love this one for many reasons. Similar to Seedsigner, it's fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, that is not for you right now if you're just starting up, but something to consider at a later stage and/or to up the security of your bitcoin. 


There's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend it as it's not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, recently said they're capable of sending customers' keys out just with a firmware update, etc. **Stay away**, save yourself a headache in the future. 

Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. 

Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. Write them down on any piece of paper as well as the receiving address. Now wipe the wallet and generate a new wallet. If the seed words are different from the first set, you're safe to use it. 

Find an option to set a passphrase and use it. This will boost the security to another level. Never store the seed words and passphrase together. Use a different medium if possible. If somebody finds both, they'll be able to steal your coin. 

This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. Also, no worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words and passphrase(s) safe.

A fraction of a Bitcoin being worth a million dollars at some random point in the future doesn't necessarily hold a lot of meaning. It might, but it might not. However, when Bitcoin is mass adopted by almost all governments, all companies, all of retail, and has multiple layers all built on top of the main chain, including for daily transactions like is already possible with the lightning Network, but also when it gets integrated for security in almost everything on a daily basis, and countless other things you can't even begin to consider yet... Nobody is even going to be asking how much Fiat a Bitcoin is worth. Everything will be priced in it in one way or another. 0.1 Bitcoin will be worth 0.1 Bitcoin and that's going to be a lot. Part of the question is, how much longer do you have to live to see far it evolves by then? Bitcoin is still a toddler at best, if that. You know how some people say that dog years is 7 years for every human year (let's set aside for a moment that that's a horrible way to calculate things since different breeds and sizes of dogs develop at different rates, but it is a common thing that people say and that's what I'm going based on)... Some people believe that if you do the same thing to bitcoin, then, since the average human doesn't have their brain cortex fully developed and stable until at least their mid-twenties, and thus aren't fully developed until at least their mid-20s, then for Bitcoin, it's mid-20s equivalent will be around the year 2140 when the final Satoshi is mined and Bitcoin is finally then a fully developed grown up. I can still technically continue to have some personal development and new skills and such with new layers and all sorts of stuff like that, but it's core biological development will finally be complete in 2140, And thus the equivalent of around 25 years old in human years. 

So yeah, Bitcoin is basically still a toddler around 3yrs and 1 month old in human years If we assume that it is the equivalent of age 25 in 2140 when it finally fully develops from its core internal growth just like a human does around age 25. 0.1 Bitcoin now will hold a ton of equivalent value eventually.

For 0.1 BTC to be retirement money, Bitcoin would need to be valued at $15M in today's money.

We're a long way from that, but fortunately, Bitcoin grows faster than inflation.

According to the power law, which is the current trendy long term forecast for BTC, the price will reach $15M around 2048. But $15M then will be worth about $7M in today's money, so not quite there yet. It's only around 2055 that Bitcoin should reach $40M, then worth roughly $15M in today's money. 0.1 BTC would then be worth $4M and be enough to retire off and sustain a middle-class lifestyle.

So 30 more years to go.

That being said, you could adjust the 4% rule by factoring in Bitcoin's accelerated growth and possibly reach retirement faster. The 4% rule is roughly based on \~10% market returns and \~3% inflation. We cannot assume that inflation will change, but by being invested in Bitcoin, that 10% return could be expected to be closer to \~30%, and thus the 4% rule to be more like the 15% rule, ie.

n2b0wn4,1lvwb0g,Abbreviations_Royal,"Idk where to begin honestly.

The numerical number of a currency does not limit its value carrying capacity at all - as long as it is subdivisional enough that it can express the lowest possible value necessary for the market.

The absolute integrity of the core protocol creates the trust needed for the market. ""LOST"" Bitcoin ie lost access to the private key controlling Bitcoin wallets is just part of  the narrative. ""Reproducing"" Bitcoin would alter a path set in the creation of Bitcoin and would be like alchemy for gold or new production of art from dead painters; horrible for the trust backing the value.

Mining is a distribution of the currency set over time in a predictable way. Everyone who have ever mined knows more or less how the mining will work now vs the future from the get to with halvings around every 4 years. Over time transaction cost will take over more of the mining rewards as the supply is made available and one day around 2140 you have what you have in terms of supply. Someone may still recover some lost keys from the early stages and I am sure there will be whole markets for digital archeology sifting through old notes etc for the chance of unlocking ""lost"" Bitcoin.

Every lost pair of keys are a gift for everyone else who have bought into the system. It is part of the natural order that over time will help spreading the value more evenly in the system as 10k BTC held in 2011 was peanuts and therefore not held as secure as 1BTC in 2025, much like a Picasso in his 20ies compared to now.

Go 100% Bitcoin, and stack as much as you can while you don’t have to worry about rent or food because you live at home. How to stack? Move your savings into BTC and then move that BTC to your own wallet off the exchange. Plan not to touch it for at least 4 years. Start a DCA. Set an amount of £s to buy and a frequency. Stick to it and make your buy regardless of the price.
Move that DCA stack to your cold storage as you accumulate 0.01 or 0.001 BTC. You can automate a DCA in Strike App
Don’t wait for a dip to get in. Just get in. In 4 years it won’t matter. Time in Bitcoin is better than timing Bitcoin.

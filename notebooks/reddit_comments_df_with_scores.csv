1lpofh3,"I'm currently thinking about moving my old workplace pension, probably around 50% of my total pensions into MSTR. I'm in my early 30s, so this represents about 10 years of workplace contributions.

If I could invest directly into Bitcoin, I wouldn't think twice, but since I'm in the UK, MSTR is the only real Bitcoin exposure I can get within a SIPP.

That said, I'm aware we're quite far along in the current cycle (assuming cycles continue to repeat). MSTR isn't true Bitcoin, and its premium over BTC could evaporate. On the plus side, at least it wouldn‚Äôt be sitting in fiat or conventional equities‚Äîalthough a simple S&P 500 index fund has historically delivered solid returns too.

What do you all think?

2. The guaranteed year 1 return of 20% of using a traditional 401k/IRA investment to buy a BTC ETF is incredibly powerful and hard to ignore. This is up to 26% if you have an employer match. Do not ditch these instruments as they are super fuel for building wealth at lower/middle incomes. Saving on taxes means stacking more sats. (But it's paper bitcoin and will likely de-peg at some point)
3. Do not discount the power of owning tax-free BTC though a Roth IRA. Imagine yourself selling small portions of BTC 30 years in the future to pay for things and having NO TAX OBLIGATIONS AT ALL. BTC gains are otherwise taxable, with a Roth IRA and a BTC ETF like IBIT they shouldn't be. This is huge! (Again it's paper, but maybe you don't care about 90c on the dollar if it's all tax free)

Hard assets will always win in the end.

It's comical that Bitcoin is trading at only $2tn when nVidia is approaching $4tn and gold is $22tn.

The incredible irony of Bitcoin is, so many people don't understand it, and even some of those that claim to will say it's overpriced/a scam.

I would argue it's the most mispriced asset in history. At absolute minimum it should today be half of gold's value thus \~$500k per coin.

Your personal phone might be compromised, and storing your seed phrase on your phone may be a problem.

If you've got another phone, then you can make a pretty fucking secure ""Watch-Only"" wallet;

- Factory reset the phone, no SIM, and connect it to your own password-secured WiFi. Get Bluewallet and encrypt it (by adding a password), make the wallet, and add a passphrase. Write everything down. Export the xPub.

- Delete everything, factory-reset the phone again, and turn it off indefinitely. 

- Install Bluewallet on your personal phone and import the xPub. Thus you have a ""Watch-Only"" wallet that only exists to receive Bitcoin and monitor transactions. The keys do not exist anywhere except on the piece of paper you wrote it down. Encrypt it again for good measure.

The only vulnerability is the length of time you had your factory-reset phone connected on your WiFi. As a security risk, it's an astronomically low security risk. If it's a 5 to 10 minutes connection, then it's a complete non-issue.

This setup provides a use case for long-term storage for a software wallet. You can safely store indefinitely.

- Wallet MUST be Bitcoin-only.
- Wallet MUST be completely open-source and audible.","I would just keep it on Kraken if you are planning to get a hardware wallet in the foreseeable future (a few months).

If you have got another phone, then you can make a pretty fucking secure ""Watch-Only"" wallet; - Factory reset the phone, no SIM, and connect it to your own password-secured WiFi. Get Bluewallet and encrypt it (by adding a password), make the wallet, and add a passphrase. Write everything down. Export the xPub. - Delete everything, factory-reset the phone again, and turn it off indefinitely. - Install Bluewallet on your personal phone and import the xPub. Thus you have a ""Watch-Only"" wallet that only exists to receive Bitcoin and monitor transactions. The keys do not exist anywhere except on the piece of paper you wrote it down. Encrypt it again for good measure. The only vulnerability is the length of time you had your factory-reset phone connected on your WiFi. As a security risk, it is an astronomically low security risk. If it is a 5 to 10 minutes connection, then it is a complete non-issue. This setup provides a use case for long-term storage for a software wallet. You can safely store indefinitely. 2 key points though: - Wallet MUST be Bitcoin-only. - Wallet MUST be completely open-source and audible.","[{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9235112071037292}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.04835786670446396}, {'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.028130952268838882}]",0.8751533403992653

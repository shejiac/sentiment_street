       "\"107k stablecoin || I'm currently thinking about moving my old workplace pension, probably around 50% of my total pensions into MSTR. I'm in my early 30s, so this represents about 10 years of workplace contributions.\\n\\nIf I could invest directly into Bitcoin, I wouldn't think twice, but since I'm in the UK, MSTR is the only real Bitcoin exposure I can get within a SIPP.\\n\\nThat said, I'm aware we're quite far along in the current cycle (assuming cycles continue to repeat). MSTR isn't true Bitcoin, and its premium over BTC could evaporate. On the plus side, at least it wouldn‚Äôt be sitting in fiat or conventional equities‚Äîalthough a simple S&P 500 index fund has historically delivered solid returns too.\\n\\nWhat do you all think?\\n\\nEdit for a typo || Just a reminder, everything is going to zero against Bitcoin. Have a great day! || Self perpetuating trend right now, when will it stop.? We just need some of those 'retail' folks to jump in....wait..that is me. || Now that's a v-shaped recovery || Bought some of those cheap sats || üö® **BREAKING NEWS EVERYONE** üö®\\n\\n‚ÄºÔ∏è **1 BTC is still = 1 BTC!!** ‚ÄºÔ∏è\\n\\nThis important announcement was just released today! What will you do with this new information?! ü§î‚è≥ || Could be a big day, seller exhaustion. || Another good start before the burgers dump || seeing what‚Äôs happening all over the globe right now, I‚Äôm not complaining with that üôÉ\\n\\nsomething like that wouldn't have been possible a couple of years ago || With you being in the uk, MSTR is a reasonable way to get exposure to bitcoin within a SIPP. Have you checked if any of the ETFs (such as ibit for example) are available? Dont know what the returns are like but maybe worth exploring the different options? || I‚Äôm (very) cautiously optimistic that cycles are going to be much more subdued, despite still expecting large price swings. Corp and ETF buying along with more retail and greater conviction should help buy big dips alongside declining supply on exchange(for now) but we‚Äôll see. || I did something similar with a large portion of my IRA in the US. Is MSTR's STRK available to you? Its a bit lower risk with an estimated 80% of bitcoin upside with only like 10% downside. Im in my 30s as well, this money cant be moved for like 20 years without big penalty so Im hoping the long game works. Easy to have diamond hands in those accounts if there is some big draw downs. || I would just gtfo the UK lmao || I think everything goes negative against Bitcoin because you‚Äôd have to pay me to take any trash that isn‚Äôt Bitcoin. || If you mean for the fireworks display in a few hours..or possibly minutes I am with you. || No I don't think you can even buy the Bitcoin ETFs in UK. The FCA won't allow it. (Financial conduct authority) || Haven‚Äôt they just green lit this though?\""

1jwz2d3,Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ - Please read!,"# Welcome to the /r/Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

It all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

* [Article: The Bullish Case for Bitcoin](https://medium.com/@vijayboyapati/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1)

You can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/live-map/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](https://imgur.com/a/5w3l2A6) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://river.com/learn/how-bitcoin-fees-work/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin try [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://aggr.trade/1m1h) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth 
--------------|--------|------------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A 
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | 

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/live-map/)

## Earning bitcoin

Just like any other form of money, you can also earn bitcoin by being paid to do a job.

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](<URL> * **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](<URL> * **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](<URL> in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them. * **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](<URL> * **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](<URL> which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work. * **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](<URL> when purchasing with cash or transacting. * **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and cannot be [brute forced](<URL> or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets. * **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](<URL> based on certain criteria being met * **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](<URL> which means you do not have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. * **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](<URL> on-chain depending on need for confirmations. Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. * **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](<URL> * **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](<URL> better than gold or fiat. * **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold. They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](<URL> (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users. Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security). * **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](<URL> and [mempool activity](<URL>#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually. On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](<URL> an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible. * **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](<URL> blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin. ## Where can I buy bitcoin? [Bitcoin.org](<URL> and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](<URL> are helpful sites for beginners. You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer. Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below. * [Strike](<URL> * [Cash App](<URL> * [Swan](<URL> * [River Financial](<URL> * [Bull Bitcoin](<URL> * [Bitcoin Well](<URL> * [Relai](<URL> * [LibertyX](<URL> * [CoinCorner](<URL> * [Bisq](<URL> (decentralized & P2P) * [HodlHodl](<URL> (P2P) * [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](<URL> * [Debifi](<URL> (non-custodial lending) You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](<URL> If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin try [Bitwage](<URL> **Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](<URL> people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. ## Securing your bitcoin With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you. * If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](<URL> [Trezor](<URL> [ColdCard](<URL> or [Blockstream Jade](<URL> is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](<URL> or [Krux](<URL> * If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](<URL> options to choose from depending on your use case. Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](<URL> are generally more secure than desktop wallets. Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites. Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets. * If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](<URL> but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk. There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. **Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access. Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below. Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes. **Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.** Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges. Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth --------------|--------|------------ [Android](<URL> | [Android](<URL> | N/A [iOS](<URL> | [iOS](<URL> | [iOS](<URL> | Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](<URL> or [Titan](<URL> to purchase security keys. ## Running Bitcoin You can run [Bitcoin node](<URL> software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](<URL> or other node software you have vetted. It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](<URL> Do not Trust, Verify. * <URL> * <URL> * <URL> A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](<URL> to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](<URL> For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](<URL>#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](<URL> and [electrum wallet](<URL> both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets. ## Watch out for scams As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the are / btc subreddit are active scams. Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin. So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil. As they say in our community, **""Do not trust, verify""**. * Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways. Use [DuckDuckGo](<URL> instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well. * Ignore private messages offering services. * **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website. * **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.** Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste. * Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [<URL> without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to. Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address. It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money. ## Common Bitcoin Myths Often the same concerns arise about Bitcoin from newcomers.

I'm in my early 30s, so this represents about 10 years of workplace contributions.

If I could invest directly into Bitcoin, I wouldn't think twice, but since I'm in the UK, MSTR is the only real Bitcoin exposure I can get within a SIPP.

That said, I'm aware we're quite far along in the current cycle (assuming cycles continue to repeat). MSTR isn't true Bitcoin, and its premium over BTC could evaporate. On the plus side, at least it wouldn’t be sitting in fiat or conventional equities—although a simple S&P 500 index fund has historically delivered solid returns too.

What do you all think?

Edit for a typo || Just a reminder, everything is going to zero against Bitcoin. Have a great day! || Self perpetuating trend right now, when will it stop.? We just need some of those 'retail' folks to jump in....wait..that is me. || Now that's a v-shaped recovery || Bought some of those cheap sats || 🚨 **BREAKING NEWS EVERYONE** 🚨

something like that wouldn't have been possible a couple of years ago || With you being in the uk, MSTR is a reasonable way to get exposure to bitcoin within a SIPP. Have you checked if any of the ETFs (such as ibit for example) are available? Dont know what the returns are like but maybe worth exploring the different options? || I’m (very) cautiously optimistic that cycles are going to be much more subdued, despite still expecting large price swings. Corp and ETF buying along with more retail and greater conviction should help buy big dips alongside declining supply on exchange(for now) but we’ll see. || I did something similar with a large portion of my IRA in the US. Is MSTR's STRK available to you? Its a bit lower risk with an estimated 80% of bitcoin upside with only like 10% downside. Im in my 30s as well, this money cant be moved for like 20 years without big penalty so Im hoping the long game works. Easy to have diamond hands in those accounts if there is some big draw downs. || I would just gtfo the UK lmao || I think everything goes negative against Bitcoin because you’d have to pay me to take any trash that isn’t Bitcoin. || If you mean for the fireworks display in a few hours..or possibly minutes I am with you. || No I don't think you can even buy the Bitcoin ETFs in UK.

The good is: now it's worth more than double. I've paid $8k in interest for a gain of $35k, a $27k profit. It is a collateralized loan so I didn't actually ""pay"", they just tacked the interest onto my loan. 

My take is: Don't take on an amount of leverage you can't handle losing, but as long as you can cover interest payments this is a winning strategy. || That’s it boys…that’s the top. || I did the same thing. I can very much afford the monthly payments and bitcoin average rate of return is much higher than the yearly interest on the loan so I’m not worried about it.  it’s also a small amount (for me) that even if bitcoin were to go to 0, I still wouldn’t lose sleep over it.

Then by all means yes. 

You have to figure out what you’re trying to do and why you’re trying to do it in your own, but I would suggest: buy the BTC, do not sell it (no matter whether it goes way up or way down), spend the next few months learning all you can about BTC (how does it work, why was it created, why do some people have the utmost belief in it while others think it’s a scam, what problems with money does it attempt to solve, what is money even, how can you safely store and secure your own BTC, etc etc. just learn enough that you can get to a point where you can answer the question you’re asking here on your own and believe it with conviction.

The biggest change in usdeur in the last 10 years was from may 2021 @ 0.82 to september 2022 @ 1.03. A 25% change in a total of 18 months.

1lptbsr,owning real btc vs buying an etf - not the same thing bro,"so people keep asking if they should just buy a bitcoin etf instead of actual btc. here’s the deal with an etf, you’re not holding bitcoin, you’re holding a piece of paper that says someone else is holding it for you. no keys, no custody, no flex.

sure it’s easier, fits into your demat account, and makes your ca less nervous. but if you’re into bitcoin for the whole “be your own bank” thing, the etf ain’t it. you can’t send it, move it, or hide it in a cold wallet.

btc etf is great if you just want price exposure and don’t want to deal with wallets, but real bitcoin is for the ones who trust code more than fund managers. your call. just know what you're actually buying.","I think it's ok that some people don't want to be their own bank. it's a big responsibility. || The only advantage the etf has is that (I can speak for myself as a Canadian) we can put it in our TFSA and it wouldn't be taxed on it when the time comes you need to sell it or portions of it. Outside of a taxed registered account, there's no need, you are definitely better to own it straight it up in a cold wallet. || damn bro wow spittin true facts and logic only the realest and toughest carry hard coins 

stay straight peaked fam || We just need more old boomers to lose their coins in cold wallet or people in general so that supply goes way down || So how do you hold stocks?

Oh, right, on a piece of paper that says someone else holds them for you… || Yes they're very different things, but both have their place in my portfolio. I hold both as both have their advantages. No reason to turn your nose up at the ETF's though especially with the potential tax advantage because that's just self defeating. The capital gains saved would vastly outweigh the funds small expense ratio || The title says it all 💯🥂🔥 || You said if feels different ? || Keep in mind these competing principals:

1. Self custody of BTC is very powerful. This is the only asset with no counter party risk. No money printing, no withdrawal shenanigans, no account freezing, just you and your codes. You either screw it up yourself or you make bank. (BUT it's taxable gains...)
2. The guaranteed year 1 return of 20% of using a traditional 401k/IRA investment to buy a BTC ETF is incredibly powerful and hard to ignore. This is up to 26% if you have an employer match. Do not ditch these instruments as they are super fuel for building wealth at lower/middle incomes. Saving on taxes means stacking more sats. (But it's paper bitcoin and will likely de-peg at some point)
3. Do not discount the power of owning tax-free BTC though a Roth IRA. Imagine yourself selling small portions of BTC 30 years in the future to pay for things and having NO TAX OBLIGATIONS AT ALL. BTC gains are otherwise taxable, with a Roth IRA and a BTC ETF like IBIT they shouldn't be. This is huge! (Again it's paper, but maybe you don't care about 90c on the dollar if it's all tax free)
4. In the very, very long term (100 years) companies will outperform BTC. BTC is a fixed deflationary asset and does no work. (Excepting some limited power harvesting gains some have pointed out) Companies by their nature do productive work in the marketplace. So growth and change and profits are the outcome. When asking if you should own BTC or stocks -- my answer is ""Why not both?""

These are all conflicting goals, each with their own upside and downside. For my part I diversify, I tend to buy the things that are on sale the most at any given time and just keep stacking. || Most bitcoiners forget to mention a lot of the details about ETFs when making this comment.

ETF bitcoin is SPIC insured.

ETF Bitcoin (in certain vehicles that are pre taxed) can be traded over and over without triggering a taxable event.

ETF Bitcoin (in certain vehicles such as Roth IRA)can be cashed out without capital gains.

There are lots of reasons that make sense financially about bitcoin vs ETF bitcoin that bitcoiners never seem to understand.

I personally like holding real bitcoin, but I do have some ETFs as well. || Also remember that all ETFs and businesses have running costs, pay nice salaries, probably waste a lot on marketing and business expenses and still need to make profit.


Bitcoin sat in your cold wallet has none of them things. || im in BTC for the price appreciation. i think the CIA created BTC to give american hegemony another 100 years before the whole bus crashes off of a cliff. 


less demand for gold as investors dump the US dollar. 


defeating the global banking cartel has always seemed like a pipe dream. 


""SHA-256 is a cryptographic hash function developed by the National Security Agency (NSA) and published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001"" || Exactly. And the tax advantage probably isn’t something permanent. I wouldn’t count on it. When pressure is high, all governments will eventually break their promises and start taxing our self contributed pension (and anything else that they can get away with). 

Australia is passing a new law that will let the government to tax *unrealised* gains on pension (called Superannuation here) account with balance over AUD 3m… it’s super disappointing that many people just don’t care because “they’re only going after the rich, I’m not rich”.

It’s exactly the modern version of “First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out, because I was not a socialist""

The good thing about bitcoin is that I can hop on a plane with 12 words in my head and there’s nothing they can do about it. 

NYKNYC never rings any truer. || I have the real deal Holyfield along with FBTC etf in my Canadian LIRA account since i can't really do anything with it until I retire. || exactly!!! || Just saying that as of now, that's the only advantage. I do agree with you, things can change.

It's comical that Bitcoin is trading at only $2tn when nVidia is approaching $4tn and gold is $22tn.

1lpr4ky,Buy BTC at a regulated bank?,"Hi all

I'm studying the fact to buy BTC at a regulated Bank in Switzerland, which offers some cryptocurrencies. 

They claim there is no wallet needed and the keys are safe with a very high standard security and it is very unlikely to get them lost. 

The bank itself most likely will not be bankrupted. 

The plus side is that if you die, it will be inherited by wife /kids.

As I only see here talking about cold wallets, I would like your opinion on that.

Thanks in advance
","An argument can be made that bitcoin is or should be illegal.  That means that anything that is not open source software will be subject to the laws of your country and therefore can be seized by your government.  For example in the USA most gold was confiscated in 1933.  The answer is obvious: self custody.

HODL || You have two of the best and most reliable Bitcoin-Only exchanges in CH and you want to rely on a bank?

Why don't you buy at [relai.app](http://relai.app) or [pocketbitcoin.com](http://pocketbitcoin.com) with low fees (or no fees 100 CHF/month max - Relai), self-custodial wallets, DCA directly to a HWW, simple and efficient apps, etc.

In case of pocketbitcoin only light-KYC (ref code ZECDE6 > less fees). 

When you use Relai's DCA (daily, weekly, monthly) and referral code ""XBT"" you also pay less than 1% fees. || Never. || Bank will be safer than a centralized exchange imo but the best is a cold wallet || Buying BTC via a regulated Swiss bank is a safer, custodial option great for inheritance planning and avoiding private key risks. You won’t need a wallet, but you also won’t control the keys. It’s ideal if you value security and legal protection, though it may lack flexibility compared to self-custody. || Not your keys not your crypto. Can you really trust banks?

Banks are the ones who introduced fractional reserve banking, thus making money out of nothing.

Holding bitcoin in a bank goes completely against the ethos of bitcoin and decentralisation. || Swiss banks tend to be very conservative and usually don't operate as crytpo exchanges. I'm curious to know which one? || It's a valid option, do what suites you best || Not your keys not your crypto || Hello, thank you for your answer. 

I never heard of these, but then why not Swissquote? Maybe because of the higher fees? 

The bank is Postfinance, they have a buying fee of 0.95%. 

Im really unsure because os the eallets and to lose the seed prase or which cant pass on if we unexpectedly die, thats why the option of a bank.  

But what in your opinion would be the downside of it? || Sygnum Bank AG is one of them. || Postfinance || No 1 downside: Not your keys - not your coins.

No 2: Banks can be and have been hacked and customer data has been leaked

No 3: Can get complicated with lots of red tape claiming/retrieving it inheritance wise (my guess)

If you don't buy massive amounts of bitcoin there's nothing wrong to keep it on Relai's or Pockets self-custodial software wallet but it's better of course to use a hardware wallet and keep the seed words in a safe place which your partner should be aware of.

My choice for a HWW is BitBox 02 - Bitcoin only, which is also manufactored by a Swiss company and intergrates seamless with Pocket and Relai.

Is it safer to keep it in the Blockstream wallet compared to keeping it on Kraken?","I'd just keep it on Kraken if you're planning to get a hardware wallet in the foreseeable future (a few months).

Your personal phone might be compromised, and storing your seed phrase on your phone may be a problem.

If you've got another phone, then you can make a pretty fucking secure ""Watch-Only"" wallet;

- Factory reset the phone, no SIM, and connect it to your own password-secured WiFi. Get Bluewallet and encrypt it (by adding a password), make the wallet, and add a passphrase. Write everything down. Export the xPub.

- Delete everything, factory-reset the phone again, and turn it off indefinitely. 

- Install Bluewallet on your personal phone and import the xPub. Thus you have a ""Watch-Only"" wallet that only exists to receive Bitcoin and monitor transactions. The keys do not exist anywhere except on the piece of paper you wrote it down. Encrypt it again for good measure.

The only vulnerability is the length of time you had your factory-reset phone connected on your WiFi. As a security risk, it's an astronomically low security risk. If it's a 5 to 10 minutes connection, then it's a complete non-issue.

This setup provides a use case for long-term storage for a software wallet. You can safely store indefinitely.

2 key points though:

- Wallet MUST be Bitcoin-only.
- Wallet MUST be completely open-source and audible. || This was super detailed wow. I’ll definitely be buying a hardware wallet so that’s probably the way to go for me.

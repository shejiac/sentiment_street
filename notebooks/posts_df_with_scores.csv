1lw9jfb,Bitcoin,Bitcoin Transfer from Physical Saved Addresses,"Hello everyone,

I'm a crypto holder. Until this week, I was storing my assets on brokers, never had any issues. However, after seeing some platforms facing problems and locking user accounts, I started researching cold wallets and other self-custody options.

I believe I now understand the basic crypto concepts: public key, wallet address, and private key.

My research led me to learn that it's possible to generate a wallet address and private key from a seed phrase. I tested this on [BitAddress.org](http://BitAddress.org) . Now, I'm trying to find another website or tool where I can enter the same phrase and verify if it generates the same private key and address, but it's been hard to find an alternative source for this kind of testing.

So here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at: I have all the generated data stored on what I call a hack proof device, a USB stick that's never connected to the internet. (Just to clarify, I haven‚Äôt fully adopted this method yet. I know a Trezor or Ledger is more secure, but as an engineer, I want to understand how everything works before I move forward.)

I discovered that you can go to a wallet service like [Blockchain.com](http://Blockchain.com), enter your wallet address and private key, and then be able to transfer funds from that wallet. However, this raises a concern: what if the website stores or logs that private key? That could give someone access to the wallet and compromise the entire idea of cold storage.

This is what led me to hardware wallets. I read that these devices perform key validation on the hardware itself. Is that correct? If so, how exactly does that validation process work?

Here‚Äôs what I imagine:

* The Trezor/Ledger software stores your public wallet address.
* When you want to send funds, you enter the transaction details.
* The software then asks you to connect the hardware wallet.
* It sends the transaction data to the hardware unit.
* The hardware use the stored private keys to find which private key matches you wallet address.
* If any private key matches the address, the hardware sends a confirmation back to the software.
* The software then calls the blockchain to transfer the funds.

Is this how it actually works? If so, that would mean the private key never leaves the hardware device, which keeps it truly secure, unlike web wallets where you must input the private key manually.

Sorry for the long text, I just wanted to lay it all out and hopefully simplify the hardware wallet concept for others too.

",MoneyRaisr,1752144228,1,1,8,,"n2cditd: It's not just matching a priv key, it uses it to digitally sign a transaction. Yes you should buy a hardware wallet and get comfortable restoring and using it.

Do not use websites to generate keys or seed words or to sign transactions for you. Do not use random scripts you download and think might be safe to run locally. They might have been good yesterday but today replaced silently and generate predictable keys that the author or website hijacker can quietly steal later.

Hardware wallet will create and manage all keys and addresses for you. The backup mnemonic or seed words can restore it all and regenerate all keys. You don't need to save addresses or public keys or any of that. You normally never even see any keys. Mnemonic must be keep secret, never entered into any online connected device or random downloaded tool. But yes it can be used that way in a pinch, in a software wallet like sparrow, to get access to the coins without hardware to sign the transactions and send off the BTC. You're not going to be stuck if hardware is lost. But remember this if you're typing your seed words mnemonic with a keyboard or phone screen then something isn't right. It should be entered only into hardware screen itself.

But if it's not a dire emergency just buy any other compatible hardware wallet and restore into it. Lately even retail stores have them so just walk in and pick up a sealed one. I recommend the new trezors or coldcard though coldcard is a more advanced tool. Mine keeps stuff I don't touch. And occasional spending is done with Trezor Safe 5 which is smooth and easy to use with trezor suit, or electrum, or sparrow, or trezor suit lite on the phone. || n2cekem: try [google.com](http://google.com) || n2cfhcp: I see, thanks for your input, I think I got the final clarification of the subject.  
  
I am going to end buying a hardware, still not sure if ledger or trezor...

I think choosing between on or other is more related to what we like the most, like choosing between coca-cola and pepsi...

What's your input between both platforms, trezor in in discounts now, safe 5 for 139‚Ç¨, Ledger is much more expensive || n2cfx7l: I have copy pasta on this.. 

[Trezor Safe 5](https://trezor.io/trezor-safe-5) is very nice to use @ $135. Touch screen, swiping, very smooth. Works with PC wallets and Android wallets. It's the best for daily users.

[Coldcard MK4](https://coldcard.com/mk4) @ $178 is great if you want high security, lots of features but not obvious on how to use. It's great if you want to pull it out on rare occasion. The dot matrix looking menus and clicky buttons offer somewhat clunkier usability, i.e. for entering your passphrase. It would take me longer to do the same send function with MK4 vs Trezor Safe 5.

The more budget option I would also recommend (and own) is [Trezor Safe 3](https://trezor.io/trezor-safe-3) @ $80. Ledger has baggage and Trezor Model One is a decade old, may soon go out of support, and same as Trezor Model T - no secure element. A more modern generation of wallets with a strong base is Safe 3 or Safe 5.

All of these options obviously come with top notch safety, secure elements, whole nine yards, not just ""looking pretty."" Do not get scammed. Do not let anyone set things up for you. Do not lose or reveal your mnemonic to any app or website to ""validate"" wallet, or ""web3"" anything, or other nonsense. Do not fall for scary looking emails telling you to migrate your wallet or some quantum thing and telling you to give up your mnemonic to some website. Doesn't matter if it looks like the hardware vendor made it. Read and follow the instructions and user guides. Enable the passphrase feature and get comfortable with how it creates an entirely separate wallet. Passphrase isn't stored internally so it cannot be extracted from the hardware by any means even if the device is lost or stolen.

I use a trezor model 3",0.6,,Bitcoin Transfer from Physical Saved Addresses,"Hello everyone, I am a crypto holder. Until this week, I was storing my assets on brokers, never had any issues. However, after seeing some platforms facing problems and locking user accounts, I started researching cold wallets and other self-custody options. I believe I now understand the basic crypto concepts: public key, wallet address, and private key. My research led me to learn that it is possible to generate a wallet address and private key from a seed phrase. I tested this on [BitAddress.org](<URL> . Now, I am trying to find another website or tool where I can enter the same phrase and verify if it generates the same private key and address, but it is been hard to find an alternative source for this kind of testing. So here is where I am at: I have all the generated data stored on what I call a hack proof device, a USB stick that is never connected to the internet. (Just to clarify, I have not fully adopted this method yet. I know a Trezor or Ledger is more secure, but as an engineer, I want to understand how everything works before I move forward.) I discovered that you can go to a wallet service like [Blockchain.com](<URL> enter your wallet address and private key, and then be able to transfer funds from that wallet. However, this raises a concern: what if the website stores or logs that private key? That could give someone access to the wallet and compromise the entire idea of cold storage. This is what led me to hardware wallets. I read that these devices perform key validation on the hardware itself. Is that correct? If so, how exactly does that validation process work? Here is what I imagine: * The Trezor/Ledger software stores your public wallet address. * When you want to send funds, you enter the transaction details. * The software then asks you to connect the hardware wallet. * It sends the transaction data to the hardware unit. * The hardware use the stored private keys to find which private key matches you wallet address. * If any private key matches the address, the hardware sends a confirmation back to the software. * The software then calls the blockchain to transfer the funds. Is this how it actually works? If so, that would mean the private key never leaves the hardware device, which keeps it truly secure, unlike web wallets where you must input the private key manually.

We all have been where you're at, read/bookmark this guide and make sure to learn along your journey. 

Congrats on the move, it's never too late, [despite new people thinking otherwise](https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/rskpuf/i_have_only_600_bitcoinsi_missed_the_bus/). ONLY INVEST MONEY YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE. 

Invest in your knowledge, learn about Bitcoin as much as you can. The Bitcoin Standard book is a must read. So is Broken Money book. Get them and READ them both, please. 

Also, **don't reply any DMs**, emails, private messages on other social media, promising to buy Bitcoin from them or get rich quick by investing into some website. They all are scammers. Even the hot Asian chick, he's a scammer too. 

**Price wise, nobody knows what the price will be tomorrow, next week or at the end of the year.** 

**Try ""Bitcoin ONLY"" strategy for at least the first 210,000 block cycle**, you'll sleep much better. Newcomers lose so much money, holding garbage tokens just because someone on YT told them to. If you don't like losing money in [failed coins](https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/how-many-cryptocurrencies-failed), avoid. 

Going DCA is probably the best approach, IMHO. 
Bitcoin to me, is a savings account. If I have some spare cash, I exchange it for sats. Once a week works best for me, but I'm getting paid weekly. If there's a 10% drop in the price since my last buy, I usually double my buy. This [DCA calculator](https://dca.bitnob.com/) might help to decide what will work best for you. In a few years, even $10 dollars a month can make a massive difference. This [DCA blog](https://er-bybitcoin.com/) is pretty interesting too and compares buying bitcoin VS stocks. 

Now, don't buy some fake bitcoin at a spot ETF place or similar, **get the real thing** that you can withdraw anytime you want. Register at a proper exchange and buy real Bitcoin. Any of these will do [https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin](https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin)

[Seedsigner](https://github.com/SeedSigner/seedsigner) - another DIY, fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, not for you if you're just starting up but something to consider later.

[Krux wallet](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/) - one more DIY hardware device, I love this one for many reasons. Similar to Seedsigner, it's fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, that is not for you right now if you're just starting up, but something to consider at a later stage and/or to up the security of your bitcoin. 


There's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend it as it's not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, recently said they're capable of sending customers' keys out just with a firmware update, etc. **Stay away**, save yourself a headache in the future. 

Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. 

Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. Write them down on any piece of paper as well as the receiving address. Now wipe the wallet and generate a new wallet. If the seed words are different from the first set, you're safe to use it. 

Find an option to set a passphrase and use it. This will boost the security to another level. Never store the seed words and passphrase together. Use a different medium if possible. If somebody finds both, they'll be able to steal your coin. 

This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. Also, no worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words and passphrase(s) safe.

Welcome to the rabbit hole and don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions anytime during your Bitcoin journey.

Also, [check the sidebar](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about) that's filled with lots of great info and if you have any questions, visit r/BitcoinBeginners or r/Bitcoin and look for the answers. || n2c1jdf: Step 1: create an account at an website or app that lets you buy Bitcoin. 

Step 2: buy Bitcoin.

Step 3: let your Bitcoin sit there an learn about Bitcoin.

Step 4: send your Bitcoin to an adress that only you control (not the app or website)

People get wealthy by holding Bitcoin instead of the Dollar, Euro or any other so called fiat currency because they constantly lose value. As long as there is enough demand for Bitcoin its price will be stable or go up compared to fiat money. 

Think long term (5 years+) and don¬¥t gamble on other cryptos, then chances are high you¬¥re gonna be wealthier than today. || n2c0y7d: You save in bitcoin. You don't have to buy it. It won't magically make you wealthy either.

What it does is protect you from slowly getting poorer compared to saving in fiat. || n2c16p2: Totally get it-Bitcoin can seem tricky at first. It's digital money, free from banks or governments, running on blockchain, a secure ledger where a network of computers verifies transactions. People often get wealthy by buying low and holding until the price soars, but it's super volatile‚Äî prices can crash too. You don't need a specific amount; you can start with as little as $10. The key is researching thoroughly, understanding the risks, and not treating it like a surefire way to get rich. It's an investment, not a shortcut. || n2c30zf: By today price not everyone can afford to buy whole bitcoin but you can start with a few bucks... it wont make you rich but gradually will grow up.

Avoid all shit coins and most important get it from certified broker. || n2c5dlx: Go read a book. || n2cnnwd: Bitcoin is like digital cash on a public ledger. Some people profit by holding or trading, but it's volatile.

Start with what you can afford to lose, use a secure wallet, and DYOR. Check r/BitcoinBeginners for basics. || n2d7ea5: For a few lucky ones, they were in the right place at the right time. For a few other lucky ones, they inherit wealth. For the rest of us, wealth building is a lifelong process - spend less than you make, invest the difference, repeat. Bitcoin doesn‚Äôt change that. What it does do is preserve the value of your savings over time. We also have the advantage of still being early in the adoption curve which will indeed help to amplify your stored value. But the ‚Äúget rich quick‚Äù time has come and gone, so you‚Äôll still have to put in the work.

As with any other type of investment, how much you have to invest really depends on your goals, lifestyle and time preference. Commit yourself to some sort of regular investment strategy - around these parts, we tend to like bitcoin as a vehicle for that investment, and a lot of us use a strategy called DCA (dollar cost averaging). Think very long term, but for now don‚Äôt invest what you‚Äôre not prepared to lose. Start small - my first transition was $20. Study bitcoin. Use reputable exchanges. Learn about self-custody. As your confidence grows, so can the percentage of your income you invest. || n2dcqon: r/BitcoinBeginners is a good subreddit for such open-ended questions || n2dmjsq: It‚Äôs a two step process.   1) buy some.  2) forget you have it and never look at the price again. || n2e0ej0: First off, realize A LOT OF PEOPLE have been scammed on fake bitcoin purchases. Billions are stolen annually!Decide how much you can afford to lose and don‚Äôt allocate any more than that.  Next, remember a bunch of THIEVES are reading your text and will DM you. Don‚Äôt trust anyone that you don‚Äôt know. The internet is absolutely full of fake platforms that will steal your money. THIEVES are cunning and think up many different ways to try and trick you. Next point, you are the only person who can decide what is right for you regarding your financial future. Due diligence requires you to research buying and holding Bitcoin SAFELY! Decide how much you are going to invest. Find a safe place to store it. A couple of thoughts here: A lot of people have had problems using COINBASE to purchase and sell Bitcoin, bear that in mind. There are other exchanges that are secure, again do your research. Don‚Äôt leave the BTC sitting on the exchange after your purchase. Store it in a cold wallet, write down everything, username, passwords, seed phrases,etc and keep it in a secure location that only you can access. It would be best if you create a new  email address expressly for your Bitcoin transactions and don‚Äôt use it for anything else. Growing real wealth is a lifelong commitment. Another thought is choose a charity to support with some of your money when you‚Äôre comfortably wealthy and do something positive with your money. Good luck. || n2c48l0: Had to check it, but the white paper still says:

""Take my bitcoin now, turn it to cash if you need to, just pay me back another whole bitcoin in X years""

How many years? What do you think the price of bitcoin will be in that time period? What does the business owner think?

Neither of you know, so why would anyone accept a loan with an unspecified interest rate? You could fund a business on maxed out credit cards for a lower interest rate than what bitcoin will likely return

It sounds like you and the business owner are the same person, which makes this even more ridiculous but changes nothing as far as what was said above || n2c0qpx: You can do it legally by talking with your accountant to inform your financial movement, and a lawyer who is an expert in legal structure.

For you to write a contract between you and your company, you, as a person, lend a BTC to your company, but you must charge a minimum interest to your company to be considered as a loan.
You can be able, with total freedom, to set the time in which the company can return the BTC plus interest in sats. Your company does not lose; it is winning since it is using leverage through the BTC to be able to expand and generate more positive flow through the loan. 

And you, as a person, are winning sats by lending your BTC to your company, in exchange for an extra %. || n2c546z: How about:

I am a Bitcoin maxi, and I think 1 million dollar Bitcoin is extremely low as a price target in 20 years, so my $100 buys are likely worth a shit-ton more than 10x, but for a mind trick I play on myself, 10x does the job :)

Stay humble, stack sats!

Do you sell 0.1 btc annually? The price will continue to go up and you would have to sell less every year. You would never run out, not even close. 

I know people say never sell, take a loan out etc. maybe by then you can do that easily, maybe not capital gains tax. I'm not counting on it. So I'm curious to see what everyone's plan is?

You see every where retire with 0,1 BTC which is around $10k on a $100k BTC price.
So even a x10 BTC at 1 million it would be $100k from your initial investment.
It really depend on Bitcoin price in 10/20 years i guess.

What do you guys think ?",OnlyBTC2035,1752119225,15,15,88,,"n2b1q1p: USD? Yes due to the network effect and governments continuing to print fiat. The question you have to ask is will $1m usd be enough for you to retire. 

If you want to retire in the US in 20 years that $1m will most likely be the avg home price. Everything else will go up in price too. || n2aydzk: Keep in mind that people were asking the same question about 50 BTC, 100 BTC, and even 10,000 BTC not too long ago. || n2b5dk7: [removed] || n2beq9f: if we step away from focusing on the price and focus more on the marketcap, it‚Äôs just not as realistic retiring on .1 btc (as an example).

for .1 btc to even be worth $5 million (which would be a reasonable retirement amount), btc would have to be $50 million per coin. a $50 million btc would have to be the current $2 trillion market cap multiplied by 500, which would be a $1 quadrillion market cap.

$1 quadrillion is 1,000 trillions, to put it in perspective.

then you also have to put into perspective how much $5 million would even really be worth if btc ever had a $1 quadrillion market cap. if the US dollar even still existed, with that sort of market cap, $5m would be worth significantly less by that time. || n2azkfe: No body fucking knows. || n2b8uly: Being a ""millionaire over time"" is almost meaningless given enough time once you understand how Fiat works. Just ask Zimbabwe how every single person in the country were billionaires, yet still all poor. 

A fraction of a Bitcoin being worth a million dollars at some random point in the future doesn't necessarily hold a lot of meaning. It might, but it might not. However, when Bitcoin is mass adopted by almost all governments, all companies, all of retail, and has multiple layers all built on top of the main chain, including for daily transactions like is already possible with the lightning Network, but also when it gets integrated for security in almost everything on a daily basis, and countless other things you can't even begin to consider yet... Nobody is even going to be asking how much Fiat a Bitcoin is worth. Everything will be priced in it in one way or another. 0.1 Bitcoin will be worth 0.1 Bitcoin and that's going to be a lot. Part of the question is, how much longer do you have to live to see far it evolves by then? Bitcoin is still a toddler at best, if that. You know how some people say that dog years is 7 years for every human year (let's set aside for a moment that that's a horrible way to calculate things since different breeds and sizes of dogs develop at different rates, but it is a common thing that people say and that's what I'm going based on)... Some people believe that if you do the same thing to bitcoin, then, since the average human doesn't have their brain cortex fully developed and stable until at least their mid-twenties, and thus aren't fully developed until at least their mid-20s, then for Bitcoin, it's mid-20s equivalent will be around the year 2140 when the final Satoshi is mined and Bitcoin is finally then a fully developed grown up. I can still technically continue to have some personal development and new skills and such with new layers and all sorts of stuff like that, but it's core biological development will finally be complete in 2140, And thus the equivalent of around 25 years old in human years. 

So yeah, Bitcoin is basically still a toddler around 3yrs and 1 month old in human years If we assume that it is the equivalent of age 25 in 2140 when it finally fully develops from its core internal growth just like a human does around age 25. 0.1 Bitcoin now will hold a ton of equivalent value eventually. How much depends on your timeline. || n2ayp29: Ummm‚Ä¶ 0.1 is 10 million broski üòé || n2bdc8p: Retirement money, in the West, is basically $1.5M in today's money, based on the median salary of $60K and the 4% rule.

For 0.1 BTC to be retirement money, Bitcoin would need to be valued at $15M in today's money.

We're a long way from that, but fortunately, Bitcoin grows faster than inflation.

According to the power law, which is the current trendy long term forecast for BTC, the price will reach $15M around 2048. But $15M then will be worth about $7M in today's money, so not quite there yet. It's only around 2055 that Bitcoin should reach $40M, then worth roughly $15M in today's money. 0.1 BTC would then be worth $4M and be enough to retire off and sustain a middle-class lifestyle.

So 30 more years to go.

That being said, you could adjust the 4% rule by factoring in Bitcoin's accelerated growth and possibly reach retirement faster. The 4% rule is roughly based on \~10% market returns and \~3% inflation. We cannot assume that inflation will change, but by being invested in Bitcoin, that 10% return could be expected to be closer to \~30%, and thus the 4% rule to be more like the 15% rule, ie. You could spend 15% of your Bitcoin every year and never put a dent in the purchasing power of your stack.

If this 15% rule turns out to be true, you'd really only need to accumulate $400K worth of Bitcoin in today's money, or, for 0.1 BTC, basically wait until around 2043, when Bitcoin reaches \~$7M, roughly $4M in today's money.

So yeah, in about 20 to 30 years, 0.1 BTC should be enough to retire on. || n2ay81z: It‚Äôs finite. Will literally go up forever. Invest regularly and only spend it when you need it. || n2ay7ng: But what would a million dollars be worth anyways in the future? Probably not zero but for sure less than its worth today so why does it matter. || n2az0qi: It's possible.  If Bitcoin appreciates 20% per year against USD, then 0.1 will be worth $1M in 2050.  Whether it can sustain that rate is anybody's guess. || n2ayi0u: It will take time. || n2b1iog: If you can buy 0.1 you can probably buy more. Ideally you are earning enough for today and tomorrow, and we choose to save tomorrows effort in bitcoin, because it‚Äôs finite. And some other fun reasons. || n2bb5pa: It's like asking will USA stop getting more federal loans. Inflation will most definetely make you millionaire with bitcoin, but million might not be that much money when that happens. || n2bgguq: Im imagining its year 2040 and the dimishing exponential curve is still scraping out new highs at 170k, 172k, 174k. But people are like ""dont worry if you hold for another 500 years youll eventually get to $10M. Try to see the big picture."" || n2bkxi7: Stop thinking and invest into it before it gets too high to even be able to get a 1/4 of a bitcoin || n2bmtsu: I would say almost certainly in next 1-2 decades. But the question is, how much a $1M will be worth that time. || n2crlqn: Depends on how much USD they‚Äôre willing to print || n2cssoy: I'm so tired of these posts.

1lvzopc,Bitcoin,Am I wasting my time with bitcoin ETFs as an NYC resident?,"Hello,

I live in NYC and thus I don‚Äôt have access to many credible exchanges such as strike or river due to the bitlicense requirement 


Thus I believe that my only options are Cashapp, Robinhood, Coinbase, and Fidelity

However I don‚Äôt trust Cashapp, Robinhood, or Coinbase as in my opinion, they are companies with shady histories (and their fees are also relatively high) 

Thus I believe my only option is fidelity, but the fees associated with fidelity are huge (1% for each buy/sell) 

Thus, I chose to invest in FBTC with an expense ratio of 0.25% 

My question is, are the ETFs the right/best choice for someone like me?

If you're simply looking to invest in Bitcoin, and profit from it's price movement, then an ETF is a solid choice.

If you want to own it outright, and be able to spend it, and not worry about counterparty risk, then holding BTC is a solid choice.

The pros to an ETF are typically lower fees and avoidance of capital gains if held in a Roth.

There's no free lunch, so pros/cons to both. || n2a983d: Why can‚Äôt you buy from Coinbase and move to your own wallet? || n2aipc4: For the majority of people, the etfs are the best and safest way to invest. || n2aa6z9: Cash App, Coinbase, Gemini, Bitstamp, and Robinhood all have a BitLicense. I don't recommend NY residents to use Robinhood because Robinhood doesn't allow NY residents to withdraw their bitcoin. All of the other exchanges that have a BitLicense do allow NY residents to withdraw their bitcoin.

You don't need to trust the exchanges. You just need to withdraw your bitcoin from the exchange once you have accumulated 0.01 BTC on the exchange.

When you buy a spot bitcoin ETF, you do not own any bitcoin. The bitcoin ETF owns bitcoin and you own shares of the bitcoin ETF. When you own shares of a bitcoin ETF, you can benefit from bitcoin's increasing value but you don't actually own any bitcoin.

You have [Benjamin Lawsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Lawsky) to thank for this because he created the BitLicense.

Benjamin Lawsky created the BitLicense and then stepped down and [opened his own law firm that advises companies on digital currencies like bitcoin.](https://nypost.com/2015/05/20/ny-financial-watchdog-ben-lawsky-leaving-to-start-firm/)

This, after his office refused to release the research and analysis during the review of the bitLicense, in violation of his own office's policies. This was specifically requested from his office by several different people and they were all ignored.

""According to Harper, Lawsky‚Äôs office violated New York‚Äôs Freedom of Information Law by refusing to release the research and analysis that it claimed to have done to validate the BitLicense regulation, and framed the regulatory discussion in a way that other regulators have felt obliged to copy.""

1lvxf5d,Bitcoin,How Hard Is It to HODL? (emotionally),"I was looking for a number that captured the emotional experience of holding bitcoin. I think I settled upon something interesting, measuring the days high as a percent of the previous all time high. Since I think we all anchor on that number it captures the days we feel like geniuses (day closes above ATH) and the days that are hard (day closes at 25% of ATH)

Some interesting numbers came out of that: on the median day measured, bitcoin was at 49.4% of the ATH, meaning most of the time when you're holding, even if you're literally up, it can feel like you're down, because you could have sold at a higher price some day previously.

You can also see that generally the swings are getting smaller. The highs are lower and the lows are high percentage wise. It might not seem like much, but I think it's significant. for example in october of 2011 bitcoin was at 7% of it's previous ATH, whereas in December 2022 it dropped to around 25%.

The numerical number of a currency does not limit its value carrying capacity at all - as long as it is subdivisional enough that it can express the lowest possible value necessary for the market.

The absolute integrity of the core protocol creates the trust needed for the market. ""LOST"" Bitcoin ie lost access to the private key controlling Bitcoin wallets is just part of  the narrative. ""Reproducing"" Bitcoin would alter a path set in the creation of Bitcoin and would be like alchemy for gold or new production of art from dead painters; horrible for the trust backing the value.

Mining is a distribution of the currency set over time in a predictable way. Everyone who have ever mined knows more or less how the mining will work now vs the future from the get to with halvings around every 4 years. Over time transaction cost will take over more of the mining rewards as the supply is made available and one day around 2140 you have what you have in terms of supply. Someone may still recover some lost keys from the early stages and I am sure there will be whole markets for digital archeology sifting through old notes etc for the chance of unlocking ""lost"" Bitcoin.

Every lost pair of keys are a gift for everyone else who have bought into the system. It is part of the natural order that over time will help spreading the value more evenly in the system as 10k BTC held in 2011 was peanuts and therefore not held as secure as 1BTC in 2025, much like a Picasso in his 20ies compared to now.

There's one really interesting thing about Bitcoin that has never happened before in human history. We have successfully tested game theory to its final evolution 

If you think about what Bitcoin is, it's a fixed supply asset. It's not gold, it's not Fiat money. It Is a fixed supply asset that we have assigned value to.  with no historical precedent who's to say this can't go to some obscene number because I can very easily figure out how it could 

Price Discovery happens on exchanges right? We know we have a fixed supply of 21 million minus what's lost is somewhere around 16 million. The mining rewards are beginning to get to be very small and in another 12 years it will be extremely small. We know Bitcoin keeps going from weak hands to stronger ones. What happens if you get to the point there's only 10 or 20 BTC on all the exchanges? You could put the price to something absolutely obscene. At that point you have a mature asset, long-term holders could slowly sell over decades and generations if they want to diversify but you would have effectively grown an asset from nothing on pure game theory into a multi trillion dollar asset || n28juxn: Even if you did, it wouldn‚Äôt have changed anything.

Do the 100 hours of research necessary to understand Bitcoin and you‚Äôll see how this IS the use case for Bitcoin. The store of value aspect of being a currency is rapidly developing. 

Personally, I‚Äôm excited. Financial markets have monetized all sorts of things today in an effort to harvest as much yield as possible. For example, housing has exploded compared to wage inflation. Why? Because the system we have set up allows Housing to become monetized, by design. 

Imagine a world where the money is valuable and the houses match their utility value, and aren‚Äôt just a number go-up safe haven for your shit fiat. 

I think a large portion of societies issues is due to fiat money printing. Income and wealth inequality and inequity, rampant and widespread pollution and ecological destruction, adult and child hunger yet high rates of food waste, homeless veterans in the wealthiest nation run by the reddest blooded people. All of it is a symptom. A symptom of a failing currency. The real grift is the dollar.

1lvqkdm,Bitcoin,Travel with wallet or leave at home,"Hi, I was wondering what everyone does when they are travelling. Do y'all take your wallets with you for domestic/international travel? What about when attending functions etc? 

Is it okay to just leave it at a safe place at home? Or keep it in some locker somewhere? I live in a rented home with other flatmates, so I am not sure how safe it is. Was just thinking about how often to worry about the hardware part of the wallet. ",lion_the_blazer,1752086212,9,9,21,,"n28aa9w: Just leave it at home. No reason to bring it with me everywhere. || n282shr: Why would you ever travel with it? Should I travel with my gold bars as well? You‚Äôre inviting misfortune. || n29h3xg: The security of your hardware wallet when it's outside of your possession isn't what you need to be focused on protecting, it's the security of your seed mnemonic.

Do your roommates know you self custody bitcoin? Do you trust your roommates? I'm assuming you don't -- because this thread you started -- so you shouldn't tell them that you self custody bitcoin. If you haven't told them, you've already completed step one in mitigating your overall risk.

Your hardware wallet has a PIN number for access, and should allow for it to factory reset itself after a certain number of incorrect attempts. That will protect against your roommates accessing your coin via possession of your hardware.

But where did you backup your seed mnemonic? Does that also live in your rented room? If your roommates found that, that could be disastrous -- there's no PIN on top of a seed mnemonic!

But there can be. If you aren't already using a 25th word passphrase, do that. That will protect against your roommates accessing your coin via possession of your seed words.

Now you're covered, so just one more question:

Are you going to spend any of your bitcoin while travelling? 

If ""No"": Leave your hardware wallet at home

If ""Yes"": Leave your hardware wallet at home, bring a hot wallet with a small balance || n29pn5g: ü§£ || n2adwkg: If you're planning to use Bitcoin on the go, you should have a separate wallet for receiving and sending mobile payments that has only a small amount. || n2ae9zv: I always travel with my Trezor, domestically and internationally, never know when I need it. The device is secure with pin and passphrase. I never travel with seed phrases they are locked in private underground vaults. If someone steals it so what I buy another. || n28fth0: I travel with two hw wallets, one stays in hotel safe and one I carry 

and another one stays home

be safe || n28krff: That‚Äôs a tough one. Risk on both sides. I would still leave it at home in a secured place.

In the event they try or do get access to your stash you know who to target vs you losing your keys randomly somewhere. || n29geod: Left mines at home during vacation, If I need to buy at any point I use my exchange. As for selling? If I am going to sell any of my assets I will do so after thinking about it hard, and that I really don't need to be able to do on the fly. Pin protect your device and for the love of god lock up that seed phrase if you have roomates. I luckily don't but regardless it's always in a locked safe which I have the key to on my belt at all times. If we're being honest here, don't travel with it, get a sturdy safe and make sure that it is untampered with. || n2b0oix: Just remember, the hardware signing device is typically password protected. It‚Äôs the private key, usually represented by a seed phrase (12 words) that must be vigilantly protected. You can lose the signing device. Don‚Äôt lose your seed phrase, or let it be seen by anyone or any camera. 

Secondly, you can research multi sig and position seed phrases in different locations. If you do a 3 of 5 then you would have 5 seed phrases and signing a transaction would require any 3 of them. In this scenario, even if 2 are compromised, your stack remains secure. || n2bgcll: My hardware wallet almost never leaves it's safe place. Travel with a secondary wallet on your phone if you need to take BTC with you. || n28eihy: Yes, you cannot risk keeping the HW wallet with other people renting your location. Also few people keep travelling with HW wallets always. If you learn to use **TailsOS+Electrum**, you don't need to worry about this anymore. A word of caution: if you use the above setup, be **VERY** sure what you are doing, else you will lose everything. Keep reading, practising a lot, have 100% confidence and then only use that setup. || n284vca: I actually get a moving company and travel with all my belongings. Only way I know it‚Äôs safe. || n28beb3: Here is another reasons why bitcoin is better then gold. You can actually travel with it and it is very safe. || n28h1z8: Because it's not like a gold bar, where someone needs to get past the PIN to actually access it.

Because evil maid attacks happen. || n29z4fx: A good opsec plan is very individual. What's right for one person may not work for another. If OP is living in a hostile infosec environment, such as with roommates he doesn't trust, then that's certainly something to consider. Off site recovery is, of course, also very important. Plan for what happens if the house burns down. || n28hida: ""be safe"" by making your home a target AND your hotel room a target while you're away, as well as making yourself a target wherever you go? Are you serious? || n290lp1: Just be aware that the most common hotel safes are trivial to bypass. Seriously, check YouTube videos, it‚Äôs crazy. 

You might consider taping it to the bottom of a drawer or removing an outlet plate. Both would likely hold out longer than a standard hotel safe. || n29griu: I forgot that I had a lil tails drive me and my hb made before I got into crypto. Very solid idea to try out thanks a lot. || n28s8h2: The hw wallet isn‚Äôt a target, it‚Äôs useless without my knowledge 

the key card in my leather wallet looks like a library card

1lvqcnx,Bitcoin,How do we recover a BIP32 mnemonic as a BIP39 mnemonic?,"I created a wallet years ago using Electrum desktop software and recorded the 12-word mnemonic seed.

I've long since switched over from Electrum to Sparrow. When I choose on Sparrow to import that wallet, it rejects its 12 words. It insists the 12th checksum word is wrong. I concluded I must have recorded the 12 words incorrectly even though I vaguely recall being very careful to record it precisely.

If I didn't still have that same, old laptop running Electrum, I may have determined my mnemonic seed is junk and abandoned hope of ever recovering its funds. But luckly I do still have it, and found the Electrum wallet's underlying file which I ported over to Sparrow for wallet-import ""by Electrum file"" instead of by mnemonic seed. What I observed next was both confusing and enlightening for me, and I'm writing this post to save others from having the same panic attack of their own. 

Wheras Sparrow refused to accept the same 12 words earlier as a legitimate mnemonic, now with the wallet successfully recreated via wallet data file, the 12 words it shows me representing the wallet were the same words! In the same order! With the same 12th checksum word it rejected earlier! How is that possible?!?

I opened the Electrum wallet file in a text editor and browsed its contents. I noticed it said it was a BIP32 wallet. Okay, I thought. I don't have all the BIP standards memorized but I guess BIP32 is the standard that made mnemonic phrases possible instead of memorizing a long, alpha-numeric sequence of private-key characters. But then, looking back at Sparrow's sub menu to import a mnemonic seed, it called it a BIP39 choice. I thought there was just one standard becuase many standards means we don't have a standard. Right? No! I see by a quick web search we have BIP32, BIP39, and BIP44. <smh>

Let's suppose that old laptop is long gone, so I don't have the BIP32 wallet data file. Only its 12 word mnemonic to recover from. 

* Using Sparrow, how would I re-establish access to that wallet and its UTXOs? 
* If Sparrow simply doesn't support BIP32 mnemonic recovery, how would I recover that wallet without going back to Electrum? 
* I'm tech-savvy but how would a orange-pilled normie/layman know how to do it?
* Seed Stamp products and such only accommodate recording the mnemonic words. Not also their specific BIP standard. But based on this wallet recovery experience, in a new Bitcoin ecosystem of software & tools several years later, it seems pertinent to tell the User ""which"" mnemonic standard their secret words are recoverable by. 
* Bitcoin is supposed to be backwards compatible, and that's a big deal. Someone recently recovered 80,000 bitcoin from a 2010 wallet just recently in 2025. Sparrow's reputation is that it's thee best desktop software for Bitcoin wallets. So why would it not be backwards compatible for an older BIP standard to recover a mnemonic seed? 
* How many people out there do you suppose have experienced this same thing I'm telling you about here and suffered deeply in isolation because they don't know what Bitcoiner to turn to? They don't even know about this subreddit? How many more will also experience future crisis because they too thought there was ""just one standard"" and that everyone in the ecosystem is on that standard?

(But does use the BIP39 wordlist for ElectrumV2 seeds) What makes things more confusing is that for a few years it was possible that a seed could have a valid checksum for both (1/16 chance as the checksum for BIP39-12word is so pointlessly weak)

BIP32 is a different standard entirely and doesn't relate to mnemonics, but rather from the key that is created from the BIP39/Electrum2/SLIP39 process. (You can export the xprv from Electrum and then import this into Sparrow as a BIP32 wallet)

Basically the question of whether Sparrow should support Electrum seeds is best directed at the Sparrow Dev, but has been answered multiple times on their Github already. (There are other wallets that support Electrum standard seeds) While Electrum only supports generating its own format of mnemonics, it can import Electrum2, BIP39 or SLIP39 seeds, and also has a very powerful account discovery feature... So IMO is still superior to Sparrow when it comes to use as a recovery tool...

1lvnt37,Bitcoin,20 Y/O New BTC Buyer! Give me advice!,"Hi all, 

I am 20 Y/O from the UK, just finished 2nd year of university living at home, I have been investing 40% of my wage from part time work into various stocks but mainly ETFs, and put the other 40% into a LISA in order to move out. Funnily enough I put ¬£3.77 into BTC in Dec 2022 when I turned 18, in which I think I sold it after a week haha, although if I kept it, I would have only had ¬£21.34, with a 465.5% increase on my investment, which is just funny to think about. 

  
But I am now joining the train for real, I aim to give BTC around about 10% in my total portfolio, and DCA'ing each month. I suppose the main questions I have are just about BTC in general, where are the best places to read up on BTC, I have fairly baseline knowledge of BTC already, but want to dive deeper.

  
I use Coinbase, how is that regarded within the crypto world, as I am coming from the investing/stock market world there are quite a few learning curves I am keen to know.

I am also planning on waiting a little while in order for the price to drop before I enter, as its at its all time highest price right now, is this a good choice, I plan on adding to it and holding for many many years, as I say I am 20 right now, so this has a lot of time to grow for me, I just hope I haven't missed the boat too much yet!

Finally, any tips/experiences whatsoever would be welcome!",daeneryssith,1752079840,5,5,14,,"n27t2hp: I'm in the UK and started March '24. 

I started with Coinbase Advanced.

Once I accumulated a reasonable amount (~0.01btc) I transferred to Bluewallet. 

I wasnt comfortable with a phone-based app. I knew I'd have to progress on to a hardware wallet, and I went down the Trezor route. (Highly recommend). 

Ive since used Strike (more expensive than Coinbase for lump buys, but after 7 days, fee free on a recurring buy).

Ive also used Kraken Pro (cheapest of the three, but quite complex. The app is ""clunky"". I didn't get on with it). 

Personally, if I'm lump buying I'll use Kraken (dont like it, but hey ho). And for dca'ing I'll use Strike. 

Other points:

Any dm you get is someone trying to scam you, no matter how helpful they sound. 

Educate yourself as much as possible. Double, triple, quadruple check everything. Be sure of what you're doing before you try and do it. 

There is no btc helpline. If you cock up, your funds are gone. || n27hbdk: Read the bitcoin standard. You should be able to find it for free online || n27hwva: DCA and stop trying to time the market. The best advice I can give you is:

Time in the market > Timing the market


I learned that the hard way || n27fx1a: DCA on autopay and forget about it for a long time.  Don‚Äôt check the price.  Just forget about it.  Others can speak to security measures, but the mind is likely to be the weakest link. Congratulations on getting some. || n27i3df: Study more 100% is the only real number not 10 || n27i3kx: Hi! Congrats on having enough understanding to even ask these questions. Let‚Äôs keep it simple. This is the advice I give young people in my family. Go 100% Bitcoin, and stack as much as you can while you don‚Äôt have to worry about rent or food because you live at home. How to stack? Move your savings into BTC and then move that BTC to your own wallet off the exchange. Plan not to touch it for at least 4 years. Start a DCA. Set an amount of ¬£s to buy and a frequency. Stick to it and make your buy regardless of the price.
Move that DCA stack to your cold storage as you accumulate 0.01 or 0.001 BTC. You can automate a DCA in Strike App
Don‚Äôt wait for a dip to get in. Just get in. In 4 years it won‚Äôt matter. Time in Bitcoin is better than timing Bitcoin.
Learn about UTXO management. Read the Bitcoin Standard. Read Inventing Bitcoin. Selling your Bitcoin should really be last resort. HODL.
Hit me back with any questions. || n27jcam: Buy with the money you dont need. || n2808ke: Just keep buying bitcoin regularly - I.e., DCA - every week or every month. Or in British terms, I guess PCA - Pound Cost Average. 

Do not sell any of your bitcoin for 40 more years. You will retire rich || n282dgb: Use the exchanges at your own risk. || n2bc4kz: You were 3 when it all beganü§£ || n2869rl: why use bluewallet i dont see a benefit? || n2aoza4: This statement should be taken very seriously. If you are going to take bitcoin seriously, then invest 10 hours and learn the foundation || n2c4hab: And? || n287rsm: In hindsight, no. 

However, it was my first introduction into generating a seed phrase, writing it down, deleting wallet, reinstating it... it developed good practices that translated onto a hardware wallet. 

Now though, I still have a small amount in a hot wallet thats obviously accessible, but I have watch-only wallets set up linked to my Trezor so I can check my balance ten times a day.",0.78,,20 Y/O New BTC Buyer!

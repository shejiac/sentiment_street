"We do this all the time in our lives. I remember hearing about this popular rapper or something called Lil Nas X for a few years and I am like what a dumb name so lame. Finally heard some of his songs and watched some videos and I am like damn this dude is talented. Growing up in the 90’s there is lots of gender stereotypes about what boys should do or what girls should do. I wonder how much of our thinking and exploring has been limited by what society or authorities or just a random person or bully says to us. There is so much stuff out there that I am also ignorant about and the only thing I know about some topics is hearsay. And guess what? A lot of people are skeptical or negative because our brain wants to naturally protect us from unknown variables. It takes a lot to be open minded to exploring something new, whatever it is, and sitting in that discomfort and uncertainty of being a noob at something. I think if anyone wants to try something new the best thing would be to just try it and not really talk to too many people about it at first. In my experience many people will respond negatively or from a fear based perspective. “I want to learn a martial art” Oh be careful you do not get injured! Oh that martial art does not work! Etc etc “I am interested to learn coding” Why bother? AI is already going to replace everyone. “I am curious about bitcoin” Oh yeah I heard about that it is a scam it is too volatile You get the point. Try to analyze other areas of our lives where we our brains or other people have tried to protect us. Maybe there is a hobby you have wanted to try but stopped yourself.

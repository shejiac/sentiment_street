1,Trading,0.3049528569915799,"Buy and sell in euros then. You got a good deal in euros 6 months ago, and the previous decade you would have been better off holding dollars than euros, so it is only recently the dollar has lost value against the euro. Good luck trading!"
1,Trading,0.28230690099717953,"OTC trading does not eliminate market impact. It is not magic. When desks receive large orders, they hedge by spreading smaller trades across exchanges and CME futures in real time. The same buying pressure hits the market, just distributed over hours through thousands of small trades rather than one massive order. The price still moves in response to the demand, but gradually rather than suddenly. Think of it as taking many small steps up a hill instead of one giant leap. The destination remains the same."

2,Security,0.34245534077605727,"Just remember, the hardware signing device is typically password protected. It is the private key, usually represented by a seed phrase (12 words) that must be vigilantly protected. You can lose the signing device. Do not lose your seed phrase, or let it be seen by anyone or any camera. Secondly, you can research multi sig and position seed phrases in different locations. If you do a 3 of 5 then you would have 5 seed phrases and signing a transaction would require any 3 of them. In this scenario, even if 2 are compromised, your stack remains secure."
2,Security,0.3135212306948155,"The security of your hardware wallet when it is outside of your possession is not what you need to be focused on protecting, it is the security of your seed mnemonic. Do your roommates know you self custody bitcoin? Do you trust your roommates? I am assuming you do not -- because this thread you started -- so you should not tell them that you self custody bitcoin. If you have not told them, you have already completed step one in mitigating your overall risk. Your hardware wallet has a PIN number for access, and should allow for it to factory reset itself after a certain number of incorrect attempts. That will protect against your roommates accessing your coin via possession of your hardware. But where did you backup your seed mnemonic? Does that also live in your rented room? If your roommates found that, that could be disastrous -- there is no PIN on top of a seed mnemonic! But there can be. If you are not already using a 25th word passphrase, do that. That will protect against your roommates accessing your coin via possession of your seed words. Now you are covered, so just one more question: Are you going to spend any of your bitcoin while travelling? If ""No"": Leave your hardware wallet at home If ""Yes"": Leave your hardware wallet at home, bring a hot wallet with a small balance"
2,Security,0.27265832735843853,"I travel with two hw wallets, one stays in hotel safe and one I carry and another one stays home be safe"
2,Security,0.2697670839317716,"Just be aware that the most common hotel safes are trivial to bypass. Seriously, check YouTube videos, it is crazy. You might consider taping it to the bottom of a drawer or removing an outlet plate. Both would likely hold out longer than a standard hotel safe."
2,Security,0.2666305682717651,"It is not just matching a priv key, it uses it to digitally sign a transaction. Yes you should buy a hardware wallet and get comfortable restoring and using it. Do not use websites to generate keys or seed words or to sign transactions for you. Do not use random scripts you download and think might be safe to run locally. They might have been good yesterday but today replaced silently and generate predictable keys that the author or website hijacker can quietly steal later. Hardware wallet will create and manage all keys and addresses for you. The backup mnemonic or seed words can restore it all and regenerate all keys. You do not need to save addresses or public keys or any of that. You normally never even see any keys. Mnemonic must be keep secret, never entered into any online connected device or random downloaded tool. But yes it can be used that way in a pinch, in a software wallet like sparrow, to get access to the coins without hardware to sign the transactions and send off the BTC. You are not going to be stuck if hardware is lost. But remember this if you are typing your seed words mnemonic with a keyboard or phone screen then something is not right. It should be entered only into hardware screen itself. But if it is not a dire emergency just buy any other compatible hardware wallet and restore into it. Lately even retail stores have them so just walk in and pick up a sealed one. I recommend the new trezors or coldcard though coldcard is a more advanced tool. Mine keeps stuff I do not touch. And occasional spending is done with Trezor Safe 5 which is smooth and easy to use with trezor suit, or electrum, or sparrow, or trezor suit lite on the phone."

3,Macro Market,0.27241368694120394,"The likelihood that bitcoin rapidly goes to 10x (lambo money) or beyond is very very small with how large it is already. Do not get me wrong, I 100% think it will be 1m/coin some day. But I think it will take longer than most expect now that it is huge and has etfs and stuff. To 10x to match gold market cap roughly will be an insane transition, I think growth will slow from here and be much less volatile than in the past now that it has become so institutionalized. But I still think it will grow faster than normal investments and will end up huge(r) one day But I have no idea. Lol "
3,Macro Market,0.26399095900372865,No actually the opposite. I do not think the world is getting off the dollar anytime soon. Not even in my lifetime and I am 37. You will want more btc today so that it can be worth millions of dollars in the future.

What does the business owner think? Neither of you know, so why would anyone accept a loan with an unspecified interest rate? You could fund a business on maxed out credit cards for a lower interest rate than what bitcoin will likely return It sounds like you and the business owner are the same person, which makes this even more ridiculous but changes nothing as far as what was said above"

10,Mining,0.17799762143520245,How is this sustainable?
10,Mining,0.16510077087844172,The supply will remain the same at 21 million. The lost coins can go back to the chain so miners can mined them again. This way you also solve the miners problem (sort of) about what is going to happen when there is no more Bitcoin to mine? Who is going to keep the block chain running?

10,Mining,0.1557914008501644,"I Do Not Know where to begin honestly. The numerical number of a currency does not limit its value carrying capacity at all - as long as it is subdivisional enough that it can express the lowest possible value necessary for the market. The absolute integrity of the core protocol creates the trust needed for the market. ""LOST"" Bitcoin ie lost access to the private key controlling Bitcoin wallets is just part of the narrative. ""Reproducing"" Bitcoin would alter a path set in the creation of Bitcoin and would be like alchemy for gold or new production of art from dead painters; horrible for the trust backing the value. Mining is a distribution of the currency set over time in a predictable way. Everyone who have ever mined knows more or less how the mining will work now vs the future from the get to with halvings around every 4 years. Over time transaction cost will take over more of the mining rewards as the supply is made available and one day around 2140 you have what you have in terms of supply. Someone may still recover some lost keys from the early stages and I am sure there will be whole markets for digital archeology sifting through old notes etc for the chance of unlocking ""lost"" Bitcoin. Every lost pair of keys are a gift for everyone else who have bought into the system. It is part of the natural order that over time will help spreading the value more evenly in the system as 10k BTC held in 2011 was peanuts and therefore not held as secure as 1BTC in 2025, much like a Picasso in his 20ies compared to now.

AI effects are easy to see, and use daily, but ask someone what a Blockchain does or why it is important, they will not know. Its really the emerging class of nerds that get it. Like microsoft or paypal or amazon back in the day, only with time do people actually realise the full potential. Eventually, the business/technology takes over once traction really starts, its all that is left after a while."
